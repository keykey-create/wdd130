    <p>Hello! I am Keyarra Bassett from Cheyenne Wyoming. Recently I traveled to Alaska, where I got
      the opportunity to see waterfalls, and glaciers. This was exciting as I adore being outside
      and hiking. I am currently studying software development at BYU-I. I am excited to learn more
      about Web Development in this course. I am hoping to eventually use the skills I learn here in
      combination with GIS in my career. </p>
